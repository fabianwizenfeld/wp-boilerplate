## wp-boilerplate

GunnJerkens Wordpress boilerplate theme + plugins

To initialize a new project, clone and then execute the init.sh script:

```
./init.sh
```

This will remove the .git folder, initialize it as a new repo, loop through .gitmodules to initialize the submodules, and install the WordPress core.

*Gotcha: the submodules will be checked out at the tip of their master branch instead of the same commit as the boilerplate repo*

After initializing a new project, enter your environment variables in wp-config.php and db_sync.sh.  You can then run db_sync.sh to sync down from the production database:

```
./db_sync.sh
```

To clone and edit the boilerplate repo normally, run `git submodule update --init` to retrieve submodules.

## Features
### Multi-environment handling in wp-config
Allows you to define settings for multiple environments. Each environment inherits settings from the `$default` settings array.

Create an empty file named `env_local` or `env_stage` in the WordPress root folder for it to pick up settings specific to those environments.

Environment hostnames are specified so that you don't have to do a search and replace in the database everytime you sync a database dump to a different environment.

### Easy Password Protection
Environments can have `'password_protect' => true`. A function in the theme's functions.php will pick up on that and require a WP login to view the site if set to true.

### Embedded media uses domain-agnostic HTTP paths
A call is made for `update_option('upload_url_path', '/wp-content/uploads');` which forces media to be embedded with a src like `/wp-content/uploads/media.jpg` instead of `http://domain.com/wp-content/uploads/media.jpg`. Coupled with defining the environment hostnames in wp-config.php, this enables us to not have to worry about doing a search & replace in the database when changing hostnames.
